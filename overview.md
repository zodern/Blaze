The Meteor Guide will have some sections on Blaze. Should they be linked to here or could we pull them into this website?
What should we have in addition to the guides the Meteor Guide has?

There also is the documentation for space bars stuck in https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/spacebars/README.md
